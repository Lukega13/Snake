## üìú Rules and Features
- [X] The snake is controlled by the arrow keys
- [X] Player can pause the game pressing the "P" key
- [X] The snake moves at a constant speed, only in 4 directions: north, south, east, or west
- [X] The snake starts at the center of the board, moving north
- [X] Snake "moves" by adding a square to its head and simultaneously deleting a square from the tip of its tail
- [X] "Apples" appear at random locations and there is always exactly one apple visible
- [X] When the snake eats an apple, it gets (1 square) longer
- [X] A snake dies by either running into the edge of the board, or by running into its own tail
- [X] If the snake dies the game is ended
- [X] The final score is based on the number of apples eaten by the snake: for each apple eated you win 10 points
- [X] If the snake fills the entire window you win!

## üõ† Technologies
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)

<br/>

## ü§î How it works

To build this software I divided the project in 7 steps:

> ‚úèÔ∏è The code is well commented so I strongly recommend reading it!

<br />

**1. Building the Stage**

The stage was built using the HTMLCanvasElement.getContext('2d') method. This leads to the creation of a CanvasRenderingContext2D object representing a two-dimensional rendering, that will be our stage.

The stage was painted using the propertys .fillStyle and .fillRect of the CanvasElement

```
// Creating the stage usind the getContext("2d") method

let stage = document.getElementById('stage');
let ctx = stage.getContext("2d");
    
// Painting the canvas stage with .fillStyle property

ctx.fillStyle = "black";
ctx.fillRect(0, 0, stage.width, stage.height);
```

It is composed by 25 * 25 squares, represented by px and py, respectively.

Each piece of the stage has a size (represented by tp), defined by the stage's size (500px) divided by the number of pieces (qp), that I've dicided it's 25.

So, tp = 500 / 25, then tp = 20

This tp variable has great importance for the game operation, because it works like a size determiner of all pieces, and, along with the ax/ay variables and the "for" loop (with the elements of the Trail Array), will determinate coordenates of the stage on wich the apples will apear and also where the snake will appear

> ‚úèÔ∏è It's as if each pixel (square) of the stage has 1 tp. As the canvas has 500px and the game has 25 pieces, so each piece (square) of the board has 20 pixels (or 1 tp)

<br />

**2. Building the Snake and How it Moves**
- A cauda da cobra √© um Array, e esse Array come√ßa sem nenhum elemento, quando ela come uma ma√ßa √© adicionado 1 objeto com as posi√ß√µes vx e vy

->>>> Como a cobra anda? (A fun√ß√£o document.addEventListener("keydown", keyPush) possui um Switch para cada tecla que atribuem uma vel(dire√ß√£o) √† cobra alterando a posi√ß√£o px e py da cobra pelas variaveis vx, e o loop....)

px e py que recebem a velocidade vx e vy que √© definida pelo keypress

.shift() que apaga o ultimo

<br />

**3. Building the Apples**

Apples are randomically generated and placed in a position where the snake's body IS NOT occupying

There is always exactly one apple visible, to generate the next apple, the current one must be eaten 

The first apple is always placed at position 15,15 (ax = ay = 15)

When player "eats" an apple another one is randomically generated again

```
 // Apple's starting X and Y point
 
 let ax = ay = 15; 
 
 // Painting the apple's position in canvas
 
 ctx.fillStyle = "red";
 ctx.fillRect(ax * tp, ay * tp, tp, tp);
 
 // When an apples is eaten
 
 if (ax == px && ay == py) {
 
 // Snake's tail gets bigger
 
 tail++; 
 
 // The score is increased by 10 and is displayed at the game screen in real time
 
 score += 10
 let finalScore = score
 document.getElementById("score").innerHTML = finalScore
 
 // And a new apple is created in a random position, which is different from snake's current position
 
 function randomApple() {
  ax = Math.floor(Math.random() * qp);
  ay = Math.floor(Math.random() * qp);
 }
 randomApple()
 
 // If the position of the new apple is equal to the actual position of the snake, then a new apple wil be generated
 
 for (let i = 0; i < trail.length; i++) {
 if (trail[i].x == ax && trail[i].y == ay && tail != 1) {
   randomApple()
  }
 }
```

<br />

**4. Starting Positions**

Snake starts at the middle of the board (1), with a speed of 90ms per square (2) and heading north (3)

The initial size of the snake is 1 square (4) 

```
1- Starting position of the snake
let px = 12; // snake's starting X point
let py = 12; // snake's starting Y point
    
2- Speed of the snake movimentation in milliseconds per square
let intervalo = null

function interval(flag) {
  if (flag) {
  intervalo = setInterval(game, 90);
  } else {
  clearInterval(intervalo)
  }
}
interval(true)

3- Starting direction of the snake
let vx = 0; // initial X speed
let vy = -vel; // initial Y speed

px += vx;
py += vy;

4- Starting size of the snake
tail = 1
```

<br />

**5. End Game Conditions**

The game can be ended in 3 ways:

- User loses by running into one of the four edges of the board:
```
// if snake runs into the left edge the game is over

if (px < 0) {
  gameover() 
}

// if snake runs into the right edge the game is over

if (px > qp - 1) {
  gameover() 
}

// if snake runs into the top edge the game is over

if (py < 0) {
  gameover() 
}

// if snake runs into the bottom edge the game is over

if (py > qp - 1) {
  gameover() 
}
```

- User loses by running into its own tail: 
```
if (trail[i].x == px && trail[i].y == py && tail != 1) {
  gameover()
}
```

- User wins if the snake occupies the entire screen
```
if (i == 624) {
  win()
}
```

When game is ended one of the functions below is called, whether the player wins or loses
```
// If player loses the gameover() function is called

function gameover() {
 let finalScore = score
 document.getElementById('gameover').style.display = 'flex';
 document.getElementById("final-points-lose").innerHTML = 'You\'ve made ' + finalScore + ' points!'

// Stops the interval of the game, stopping the entire game

 interval(false)
 gameisover = true
}

// If player wins the win() function is called

function win() {
 let finalScore = score
 document.getElementById('win').style.display = 'flex';
 document.getElementById("final-points-win").innerHTML = 'You\'ve made ' + finalScore + ' points!'

 interval(false)
 gameisover = true
}
```

<br />

**6. Score**

Score starts at 0 and each "eaten apple" (snake passes through) gives 10 points for the player

It's verified by the code below

```
// When game starts the score is reseted and the score screen is showed along with the game screen

let score = 0
document.getElementById('score').style.display = 'block'
document.getElementById("score").innerHTML = '0'

// When the snake's head position (px,py) is equal to the apple's position (ax,ay)...

if (ax == px && ay == py) {

//The score is increased by 10 
score += 10

// And is displayed at the game screen in real time
let finalScore = score
document.getElementById("score").innerHTML = finalScore
}
```

<br />

**7. Aditional Features**

- Instructions Screen
```
//The functions to enter and exit the Instructions Screen by clicking at the button on Menu Screen

function showInstructions() {
 document.getElementById('instructions-board').style.display = 'flex'
}

function exitInstructions() {
 document.getElementById('instructions-board').style.display = 'none'
}

```

- Pause and Resume

When player presses the "P" key on keyboard the pause() function is called and game is paused. When pressed again, the game is unpaused.

```
// 1- The keyPush() function understands when "P" key is pressed and calls the pause() function

document.addEventListener("keydown", keyPush);

function keyPush(event) {

 switch (event.keyCode) {
        
  case 80: // "P" key for pausing the game
   pause()
   break
  
  default:

   break;
 }

}
    
// Show variable is used to make sure that when player presses the "P" key for the 2¬∫ time, the game can only be unpaused
let show = true

// The gameisover variable is used to make sure that the game can only be paused and unpaused when game is running
let gameisover = false

// 2- When pause() is called, and Game is not Over, it can do 2 thinks, depending of the situation of the show variables:

function pause() {

 if (gameisover == false) { // Confirms if Game is not Over
 
  if (show == true) { // 1. When "P" is pressed for the first time show will be true and the game will be paused
  interval(false)
  document.getElementById('pause-screen').style.display = 'flex'

  } else { // 2. But, when "P" is pressed for the second time show will be false and the game will be unpaused

   interval(true)
   document.getElementById('pause-screen').style.display = 'none'

  }

  show = !show // Changes the variable show from true to false or false to true
 }
}
```

- Restart or Back to Menu

After Game Over player can decide either Restart the game or go Back to the Menu Screen

```
//The function calls the start() function of the game again and removes the Game Over Screen
function reset() {
 document.getElementById('gameover').style.display = 'none';

 start()
}

//The function simply reloads the page
function menu() {
 window.location.reload()
}

```
